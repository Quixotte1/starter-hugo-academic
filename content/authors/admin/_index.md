Hi there, thanks for visiting my website! I am a final year undergraduate student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, **Beijing Institute of Technology**, majoring in **Data Science**. **My GPA is 91.5/100**. My research interests include **Geometric Deep Learning**, **Graph machine learning** and **Data mining** in general. Recently, I am focusing on exploring the intersection of self-supervised learning and graph neural networks at both the theoretical and applied levels.

I am currently a research intern in the **KEG** lab at **Tsinghua University**. There I am very fortunate to be advised by [**Prof.Jie Tang**](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/) and [**Prof.Yuxiao Dong**](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/yuxiao/). I am also a research intern at **Zhipu AI** company, where I am a member of the [CogDL (a toolkit for DL on Graphs)](https://cogdl.ai/) team. I have had the pleasure of working with [**Prof.Yao Ma**](https://web.njit.edu/~ym329/) and [**Prof.Rong-Hua Li**](https://ronghuali.github.io/ronghuali.html) in the past.

* **I am actively looking for Ph.D. programs starting in Fall 2023. Please feel free to drop me an email for any form of communication or collaboration!**
