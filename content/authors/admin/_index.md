Hi there, thanks for visiting my website! I am a final year undergraduate student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, **Beijing Institute of Technology**, majoring in **Data Science**. My research interests include **Geometric Deep Learning**, **Graph machine learning** and **Data mining** in general. Recently, I am focusing on exploring the intersection of self-supervised learning and graph neural networks at both the theoretical and applied levels.

I am currently a research intern in the **KEG** lab at **Tsinghua University**. There I am very fortunate to be advised by **Prof.Jie Tang** and **Prof.Yuxiao Dong**. I am also a research intern at **Zhipu AI** company, where I am a member of the CogDL (a toolkit for DL on Graphs) team.

* **I am actively looking for Ph.D. programs starting in Fall 2023. Please feel free to drop me an email for any form of communication or collaboration!**
